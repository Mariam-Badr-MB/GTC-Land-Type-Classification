## Project 14: Land Type Classification using Sentinel-2 Satellite Images

This project develops a machine learning model to classify land cover types in Egypt 
using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The system detects categories such as agriculture, 
water bodies, urban areas, deserts, roads, and tree cover. 

The workflow includes data preparation, exploratory analysis, model training & validation, 
and deployment through a lightweight web app. Final deliverables are a trained model, 
performance report, and an interactive application for testing land classification.
